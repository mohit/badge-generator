## Fix Log

### Round 1 (engineer)

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | XSS in prompt-to-badge result | Fixed — `escapeHtml()`, `safeHttpUrl()`, `.textContent` |
| 2 | H1 clipped by `max-width: 14ch` | Fixed — widened to 22ch desktop, 20ch mobile |
| 3 | Challenge result missing verification ladder | Fixed — ladder rows with `ladderRow()` helper |
| 4 | Nav inconsistency across pages | Fixed — standardized to Home/Verify/Vision |
| 5 | Quickstart step mismatch | Fixed — both start with `POST /public/api/issuers/verify` |
| 6 | Trust-write example used auth endpoint | Fixed — public no-key curl example |
| 7 | Redundant footer copy | Fixed — "Built by Firmament Works." |
| 8 | Missing issuer/verifier persona cards | Fixed — "Who this serves" grid-2 section |
| 9 | "Conversion path" jargon header | Fixed — "How to issue your own" |
| 10 | "Trust identity rules" jargon header | Fixed — "How issuer identity works" |
| 11 | Double section-muted on vision page | Fixed — removed muted from identity section |
| 12 | Dark copy button on light background | Fixed — `.copy-btn-light` variant |
| 13 | Design tokens partially migrated | Partially fixed (completed in round 2) |
| 14 | `--shadow-lifted` unused | Fixed — card hover states |
| 15 | API page missing differentiation section | Fixed — SSRF/domain/agent cards restored |
| 16 | OG PNG validity | Confirmed — PNG 1200x630 8-bit RGBA |

### Round 2 (reviewer)

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 17 | Homepage two consecutive section-muted (lines 169+195) | Removed `section-muted` from Step 0 challenge-grid section |
| 18 | Vision page three consecutive unstyled sections | Added `section-muted` to "Now, next, later" section |
| 19 | Design tokens — ~25 hardcoded font-sizes remaining | Migrated all to `var(--text-xs/sm/base/md)`. One mobile override (0.64rem) intentionally below token range. |
| 20 | Footer links inconsistent across pages | Standardized: all pages now include Home, Verify, API, Vision, Challenge, llms.txt (homepage omits Home) |
| 21 | API page not in nav | Added API to nav on all 5 pages |

## What's Working Well

1. **Two-state trust model** — `DOMAIN_VERIFIED_SIGNATURE` / `UNVERIFIED` rendered consistently on every page with domain-first issuer identity, key fingerprints, and caveat banners.

2. **Example.com demo domain** — Server uses `DEMO_DOMAIN_SUFFIX = 'example.com'`, frontend labels DEMO, challenge page explains the label, sample badges use example.com issuer.

3. **Copy voice** — Direct, imperative, honest about scope. "Sign badges. Verify domains. Share proof." H1, two-state explanations, locked caveat phrases.

4. **Design system cohesion** — Type scale tokens (`--text-xs` through `--text-hero`), spacing tokens, color tokens, and shadow tokens are now used consistently. Only one sub-token mobile font-size remains.

5. **Challenge page flow** — Hero → start → full verification ladder → share templates → conversion steps → prompt-to-badge demo. XSS-safe throughout.

6. **Navigation and footer** — All pages: Home/Verify/API/Vision in nav. Footer adds Challenge and llms.txt. API page now discoverable from nav.

7. **Card interactions** — `--shadow-lifted` on hover with translateY(-2px). `.copy-btn-light` variant for light backgrounds.

8. **Section rhythm** — Alternating muted/plain sections across all pages. No consecutive same-type sections.

9. **OG and favicon** — Valid 1200x630 PNG OG image, SVG favicon with trust-blue to verify-teal gradient.
